# Solutions to various HashTable questions in C-Sharp

In this repository I will try to solve various Hashtable questions using C#

In most of my solutions I would be using Dictionary class in .NET framework, it is important to note the usage of Dictionary vs Hashtable.

1. Dictionary is a special type of hastable where in it supports generics and it is type safe as well.
2. Dictionary uses chaining as collision resolution strategy where as hashtable uses re-hashing.
